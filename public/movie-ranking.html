<h2>Top 3 Television Shows of 2023</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Barry</h3>
<p>
  A dark character study with biting wit and an unflinching view on violence in
  Hollywood. Barry, focuses on the world of being a professional assassian,
  juxtaposed with the humor of being an actor in LA.
</p>
<h3>Trigun Stampede</h3>
<p>
  Rebooted from the original 90's anime, Trigun Stampede utilizes gorgeous
  animation and increases the pace of the drama and removes problematic "humor"
  for the original series.
</p>
<h3>Mr. Robot</h3>
<p>
  This drama focuses on the double life of Eliot, a hacker and cybersecurity
  engineer, who struggles with isolation and paranoia. Mr. Robot accurately
  depicts hacking in a way the very few shows and movies get right.
